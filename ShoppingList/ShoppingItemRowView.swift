// ONE MAJOR ITEM.  my method of deleting (tap, go to edit screen,
// tap "Delete This Item," and then returning was working EXCEPT FOR ONE CASE:
// if the list had only one item and you use this delete methodology,
// the program would crash in this View. Essentially, there would be
// crash in calling for item.name! and item.location!.name because
// CoreData had deleted the item (but this was still hanging on to it),
// so it would be a faulted reference with no name and cause of the dreaded
// attempt to force unwrap a nil message.  so you now see nil-coalescing
// code below to work around this problem, although, let's be honest:
// I haven't solved the problem at all, I have just kept the code from crashing.
// eventually i'll get this fixed (!)


struct FlawedShoppingItemRowView: View {
	// shows one line in a list for a shopping item, used for consistency
	// note: we must have the parameter as an @ObservedObject, otherwise
	// edits made to the ShoppingItem will not show when the ShoppingListView
	// or PurchasedListView is brought back on screen.
	@ObservedObject var item: ShoppingItem
	var showLocation: Bool = true
	
	var body: some View {
