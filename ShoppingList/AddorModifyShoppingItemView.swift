	// in a NavigationLink)

	// editableItem is either a ShoppingItem to edit, or nil to signify
	// that we're creating a new ShoppingItem in this View.

	// allowsDeletion is usually true: we will show a "Delete this Item"
	// button.  however, if we do Locations -> EditorModify -> select one
	// of the items at this location -> Delete this Item, we have a problem.
	// the editableLocation in AddOrModifyLocationView cannot be an observable
	// object, because i allow it to be nil; and so deleting an item this deep
	// in the navigation hierarchy doesn't trickle back to the AddOrModifyLocationView
	// and the view still shows the item at that location.  then, trying to look
	// at the item causes a crash, because it's not there and we crash.
	// so when AddOrModifyLocationView presents this view, we'll set this
	// to false.  yes, it's kludgey, but time will tell if there's an easier
	// way to do this.  you just can't make a binding to an optional ObservedObject?
	var allowsDeletion: Bool = true
	
	// addItemToShoppingList just means that by default, a new item will be added to
	// the shopping list, and so this is true.
	// however, if inserting a new item from the Purchased list,
	// this will be set to false. the user can override here if they wish.
	var addItemToShoppingList: Bool = true
	
	// this editableData stuct contains all of the fields of a ShoppingItem that
	// can be edited here, so that we're not doing a "live edit" on the ShoppingItem.
	// itself.  this will be defaulted properly in .onAppear()
	@State private var editableData = EditableShoppingItemData()

	// this indicates whether the editableData has been initialized from an incoming
	// editableItem and it will be flipped to true once .onAppear() has been called
	// and the editableData is appropriately set
	@State private var editableDataInitialized = false
	
	// showDeleteConfirmation controls whether a Delete This Shopping Item button appear
	// to confirm deletion of a ShoppingItem
	@State private var showDeleteConfirmation: Bool = false
	
	// this "itemToDeleteAfterDisappear" variable is a place to stash an item to be deleted, if any,
	// after the view has disappeared.  seems like a kludgey way to do this, but also seems
	// to work without incident (instead of deleting first then popping this view back
	// to its navigation parent, which seems to want to crash sometimes)
//	@State private var itemToDeleteAfterDisappear: ShoppingItem?

	// to delete this ShoppingItem.  the problem is one of timing, however.
	// if you delete too soon, you are deleting "underneath" the shopping list
	// and that's a potential crash, and so that's why we wait for onDisappear()
	// so the shopping list has "almost" fully taken control back.  but even
	// that seems to be a timing issue in iOS 14, so this now has an additional
	// 0.35 second delay.  even this has other issues associated with it, since we're
	// trying to guess on timing; and what happens if the user tries to use this item
	// before the delete comes around?  we could put a boolean mark on the ShoppingItem
	// to say that it's going to be deleted, then not allow ourselves to do anything
	// to such an item (!)
