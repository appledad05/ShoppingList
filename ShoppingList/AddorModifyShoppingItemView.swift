	// allowsDeletion is usually true: we will show a "Delete this Item"
	// button.  however, if we do Locations -> EditorModify -> select one
	// of the items at this location -> Delete this Item, we have a problem.
	// the editableLocation in AddOrModifyLocationView cannot be an observable
	// object, because i allow it to be nil; and so deleting an item this deep
	// in the navigation hierarchy doesn't trickle back to the AddOrModifyLocationView
	// and the view still shows the item at that location.  then, trying to look
	// at the item causes a crash, because it's not there and we crash.
	// so when AddOrModifyLocationView presents this view, we'll set this
	// to false.  yes, it's kludgey, but time will tell if there's an easier
	// way to do this.  you just can't make a binding to an optional ObservedObject?

	// addItemToShoppingList just means that by default, a new item will be added to

	// for XCode 11.6/iOS 13.6, this eliminates the console messages about views being told
	// to layout outside their view hierarchy -- this View will be gone and we'll have returned
	// to the View we came from and it will be onscreen when it gets the deletion.
	// curiously, in the Stanford CS193p lectures of Spring, 2020, Paul Hegarty used
	// this technique at one point in a similar situation to "let things settle down."
