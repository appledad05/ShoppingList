// ONCE AGAIN: i pulled this code out of the List/Section/ForEach/NavigationLink
// hierarchy above to simply the code, initially without @ObservedObject.
// then updates in the LocationTabView were not updated.  then i went
// back and added @ObservedObject and all visual updates work fine, again.
// so even though this is read-only code, identifying the variable
// as an @Observed object causes SwiftUI to update this view properly.

				Text("\(location.items!.count) items")
