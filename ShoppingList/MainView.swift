// the MainView is where the app begins.  it is a tab view with three
// tabs, all inside a NavigationView.  not much going on here, other
// than to track the selected tab (1, 2, or 3) so that we can set
// the navigation title appropriately.

// one programming note: the .onAppear() modifier is nothing you'd use
// in a production situation.  it's only here for development and
// debugging purposes, to either load default data on startup, or to
// dump the current state of of the CoreData database to JSON.

			// to see what happens with my current investigation into sectioning the list of shopping items.
			// there seems to be a major problem -- surely with View2 when deleting some, but not all, of
			// the items in some sections; and maybe this happened one time in View1 when the list went
			// empty (although i think the database was inconsistent at that point)
			// -- it goes BOOM.  i'm working on it.
