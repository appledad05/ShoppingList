// a ShoppingListViewModel object provides a window into the Code Data store that
// can be used by ShoppingListTabView1, ShoppingListTabView2, and PurchasedTabView.
// it provides both data out for the view to consume, and handles user intents from the View
// back to Core Data (with notification to the View that the viewModel has changed).

	// all together, it's useful to define the types for clarity, and record which one we are

	// for the case of managing a list of items at a specific location, we will

	// clumsy to do it this way -- it'd be nicer to attach the location directly
	// to the case locationSpecificShoppingList as associated data; this may happen
	// eventually, but in the current code sequence at the call site, i don't
	// know the location at the time i create the model.

	// the model for, e.g., deleting a location moves a whole buch of items to
	// the Unknown Location, which affects what we model -- so we will subscribe
	// to their changes (all are Core Data items, so all are ObservableObjects)
