import SwiftUI

// This is just a straightforward list display of items on the shopping list.
// a simple @FetchRequest gets these items, arranged by their location's
// visitation order, a copy of which is kept in the shopping item itself.
// why is this kept here, as duplicate information?  if you change a Location's
// visitation order, copying that to the items in the location makes sure that
// this sees the changes.

// MAJOR NOTE HERE: remember that the .onDelete() swipe action is not really
// doing a delete, but just a simple "move this item to the purchased category."
// to delete an item, tap to go to the edit screen, and then tap "Delete this
// Item."  i like the swipe action, but it does not make sense at this point
// in SwiftUI that swipe means delete.  perhaps SwiftUI 2.0 will have an
// .onSwipeTrailing() and .onSwipeLeading() modifier to allow what we're doing.

// AND ONE OTHER MAJOR ITEM.  my method of deleting (tap, go to edit screen,
// tap "Delete This Item," and then returning was working EXCEPT FOR ONE CASE:
// if the list had only one item and you use this delete methodology,
// the program would crash.  I'm still interested in resolving this bug, but I
// have for now patched the code that was crashing in ShoppingItemRowView.
// you can see a note there
