// a LocationsListViewModel object provides a window into the Code Data store that
// can be used by LocationsTabView.  it provides both data out for the view to consume,
// and handles user intents from the View
// back to Core Data (with notification to the View that the viewModel has changed).

class LocationsListViewModel: ObservableObject {
	
	// the items on our list
	@Published var locations = [Location]()
	
	// quick access to count
	var locationCount: Int { locations.count }
	
	// have we ever been loaded or not
	private var dataHasBeenLoaded = false

	
	init() {
		// sign us up for Location change operations
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationAdded),
																					 name: .locationAdded, object: nil)
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationEdited),
																					 name: .locationEdited, object: nil)
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationWillBeDeleted),
																					 name: .locationWillBeDeleted, object: nil)
		
		// we also have to watch for deletions of ShoppingItems (see explanation below)
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(shoppingItemWillBeDeleted),
																					 name: .shoppingItemWillBeDeleted, object: nil)
		// however, we do not need to watch for shopping items being added or edited here because
		// (1) an addition cannot take place while we are "in the LocationsTabView," and
		// (2) an edit of a shopping item does not affect the display of the LocationsTabView
		
		// THIS BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING SUBTLETY ABOUT A VIEWMODEL. it needs to be aware of any
		// change in the model that affects the view.  it's not just about the array of objects
		// represented, but about ANY aspect of the model that's displayed, even if an object
		// itself has not change.  Core Data clearly illustrates this point: when the Locations tab
		// is chosen, a shopping item can still be edited (tap location -> tap item in list of
		// items at the location -> edit the item), but the LocationsTabView shows no information
		// about specific shopping item data.
		// the situation for deleting an item is different because the LocationsTabView displays
		// the number of items at a location.  that's not an attribute of a Core Data entity; but
		// we are changing the NSSet of shopping items for the location, and so this is, effectively,
		// an edit of the Location because we display the count of the NSSet, and this does change
		// and the View needs to know that.
